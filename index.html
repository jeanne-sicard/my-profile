				<p>
					I'm 21 and was born in Lille in the North of France. But currently I'm a first-year student at Audencia Business School in Nantes. I am also part of the organizing team of the 33rd edition of the Triathlon Audencia-La Baule !
					And... I am very interested in learning to code !

				<h2>Triathlon Audencia-La Baule 🏊🚴🏃</h2>
				<p>
					In Audencia, I joined the organizing team of one of the biggest triathlons in Europe : the Triathlon Audencia-La Baule (7 000 athletes and 70 000 spectators). I am in charge of the relations with sponsors and partnerships. It will take place on the weekend of the 12th and 13th of September 2020 !

				<h2>🚊 Living and moving between Lille and Nantes ✈️</h2>
				<p>
					Since September I have made a lot of new friends and adapted quickly to my new city. But I like to come back to my hometown regularly. I try to come back once or twice between each holidays. I usually take the train but sometimes, when it's cheaper, I take the plane. It's quicker but more polluting...🌍
